\section{Iteration}

Let $n = 1\cdotsN$ denote the learning epoch. Each epoch consists of
Phase B (weight copying), followed by Phase C (causal inverse
learning). In the following we use superscript indices $n,B,C$ to
distinguish between quantities from different epochs and phases within
epochs.

\subsubsection{Phase B -- activity copying}

From \eqref{HVA-RA}, and with $RA_t = w_{LMAN}\LMAN$ it follows:
\begin{equation}
\triangle w_{\HVC \to \RA}(t)  = \left(w_\LMAN\LMAN -
  \oHVC_{t-\Delta} \right) \, \HVC_{t-\Delta} \,, \label{j1}
\end{equation}
However we are singing from LMAN with no auditory feeback and LMAN is
driven from HVC. It therefore reproduces the auditory representation
of the tutor song:
\begin{equation}
  \LMAN = \AUDTUT_\Delta = w_{MEM} \HVC \label{j2}
\end{equation}
If we apply one shot learning, then $w_{hvc}$ and remember that $\HVC
= \one$, then $w_{hvc} = \RA = w_\LMAN \LMAN = w_\LMAN \AUDTUT_{delta}
