predictiveInverse.m:
  ~ adapted from Matlab to Octave (minor)
  ~ does predictive (or was it postidictive) learning in the form of
    what Walter thought when we started collaborating 
predictiveInverse.py:
  ~ my 1:1 translation of the above to python (it seems to be ca

zebrafinch.py
  ~ my implementation of Walter's and my model of postdictive learning
