## Synopsis

This repository contains code to run the simulations that are reported in a manuscript entitled "Prospective Coding by Spiking Neurons" submitted to PLOS Computational Biology on 25 June 2015.

## Dependencies

The C code includes some headers from the GNU Scientific Library http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ and is tested with gcc version 4.8.2.

Figures are generated with Mathematica 9 http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-9/

## Running the simulations

Run **make all** in the root directory. On a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3520M CPU @ 2.90GHz this takes approximately 25 minutes.
